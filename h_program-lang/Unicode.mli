     Convert non-ascii whitespace to space characters and
     other characters to 'Z' characters. The number of replacement
     characters is adjusted to as to match the number of bytes of the original
     character.

     This is meant to be used as a hack to tolerate non-ascii input in
     lexers that only support ascii.
